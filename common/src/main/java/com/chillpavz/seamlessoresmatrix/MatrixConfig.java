/**
 * Plain values holder that worldgen reads.
 *
 * <p>Lives in {@code common} and holds no library types. Cloth Config's annotated class cannot live
 * here, because loader dependencies are not on common's classpath, so each loader module owns its
 * own annotated copy and pushes the values in here through {@link #apply}. Keep the two loader
 * copies identical.
 *
 * <p><b>Config affects worldgen only, never registration.</b> The registered block set is derived
 * from the loaded mod set so a client and a server always agree; if config could add or remove
 * blocks, a mismatch would kick players on join. Switching a stone off only means its variants never
 * generate: the blocks still exist, in the creative tab and in every tag.
 *
 * <p>Changes take effect the next time a world loads, because the injection runs at server start.
 * Already-generated chunks never change either way.
