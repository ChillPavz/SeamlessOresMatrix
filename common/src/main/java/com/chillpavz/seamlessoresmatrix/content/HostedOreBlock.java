 * <p>The sound cannot be baked into the block properties the way Seamless Ores does it: the stone
 * belongs to another mod, which may not have registered yet when we do. So it is looked up from the
 * stone on first use instead, and falls back to the vanilla ore's own sound if the stone is absent.
