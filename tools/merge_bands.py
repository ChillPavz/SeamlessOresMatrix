"""Joins the 26.1.x and 26.3 builds into one jar per loader that runs on every 26.x version.

    ./gradlew build -Pmc=26.3
    ./gradlew build -Pmc=26.1.x
    python tools/merge_bands.py

The 26.1.x jar is compiled against the oldest version, and every reference in it outside the era261
worldgen classes resolves on 26.2 and 26.3 as well. What changed shape at 26.3 is one class, Era263,
compiled against 26.3 and loaded by name only there (see OreSites). So the merged jar is the 26.1.x jar
plus the 26.3 jar's Era263 classes, with:
  - the access widener and transformer carrying both eras' lines (a line naming a class a version does
    not have is never applied there),
  - the Minecraft and NeoForge ranges widened from the lower band's floor to the upper band's ceiling.
Everything else must already be identical in both jars, data included (each era's loot is a pack
overlay), and the merge stops if it is not. The two band jars are removed from build/libs afterwards,
so only the file to upload is left.
